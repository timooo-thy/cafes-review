## Getting Started for Further Developments

### Prerequisites
- Python installed on your local machine. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

### Clone the Repository
Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/timooo-thy/cafes-review.git
```
### Create and Activate Virtual Environment (optional)
It's recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies for this project. You can use a virtual environment tool like `venv` or `virtualenv` to create a virtual environment. For example, to create a virtual environment using `venv`, you can run the following command in your project directory:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
This will create a virtual environment named `venv` in your project directory.

To activate the virtual environment, use the appropriate command based on your operating system:
- On Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
- On macOS and Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
### Install Dependencies
After activating the virtual environment (if you're using one), install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Run the Flask App
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the Flask app using the following command:
```bash
python app.py
```
Replace `app.py` with the name of your Flask app file. This command will start the Flask development server, and your app will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.

Note: Make sure to update the Flask app file (`app.py` in this example) with the necessary code for your cafes review project, including routing, templates, and database connections if applicable.
